    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import convertPath from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-convert-path@v0.2.0-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### convertPath( from, to )

Converts between POSIX and Windows paths.

```javascript
var p = convertPath( 'C:\\foo\\bar', 'posix' );
// returns '/c/foo/bar'
```

The following output path conventions are supported:

-   **win32**: Windows path convention; e.g., `C:\\foo\\bar`.
-   **mixed**: mixed path convention (Windows volume convention and POSIX path separator); e.g., `C:/foo/bar`.
-   **posix**: POSIX path convention; e.g., `/c/foo/bar`.

<!-- Package usage notes. Make sure to keep an empty line after the `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   A Windows [extended-length path][extended-length-path] **cannot** be converted to either a `mixed` or `posix` path convention, as forward slashes cannot be used as path separators.
-   If a POSIX path begins with `/[A-Za-z]/` (e.g., `/c/`), the path is assumed to begin with a volume name.
-   The function makes no attempt to verify that a provided path is valid.
